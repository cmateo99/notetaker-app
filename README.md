Title: Notetaker Application

The Note Taker application allows users to write and save notes. It utilizes an Express.js, and it stores and retrieves note data from a JSON file.
The application provides a notes page, where users can view existing notes listed in the left-hand column and enter new note titles and text in the right-hand column. The application features a save icon in the navbar, allowing users to save their notes, which will then appear in the left-hand column with other notes. Users can click on existing notes in the list to display them in the right-hand column. Additionally, users can click on the write icon to be presented with empty fields to make a new note.
